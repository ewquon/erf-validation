# GABLS1

For details of the study, see: Beare et al 2006 BLM (LES intercomparison),
Cuxart et al 2006 BLM (SCM intercomparison), and the Holtslag et al 2011
report from the ECMWF GABLS Workshop for an overview.

These cases were last run with commit f97cda0460a6f30eea16a7b988569f4494c2181e
compiled with the `ERF_EXPLICIT_MOST_STRESS` option. Results are for 3.125 m
grid spacing.

The analysis presented here builds upon the load_data tools from
https://github.com/Exawind/wind-energy/tree/master/GABLS and includes the
following simulation data as a reference:

* AMR-Wind results from commit daaf47081e384bd9ff05b0ce4a520682783593aa
* Nalu-Wind results from commit 1a49e8da490146698c8645700e1e37ab5931904f
